# Things Talked on April 6th, 2022
- we either have some very interesting behavior or a bug, so... plz try hard to find bug!
- when is similarity small? (that is mean squared error or cca): i.e. look at the lower left hand triangle; WHY IS IT THAT BIG RESNETS HAVE A DIAGONAL WHILE THE SMALL ONES HAVE A TRIANGLE?
- right after you finish images go see what size resnets start to "phase transition" (those that go from triangles to diagonals)
- Look into CCA for similarity loss, also maybe correlation? random trials
- Tianhong thought we should look at densenet (vary skips: to the end, and/or none)

If I want to submit to MurJ I need to get my shit together!
