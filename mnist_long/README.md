# Feature Requests
1. Seperate number of training epochs for stitches vs. for source networks
2. More efficient stitching; abandon stitch mode and instead adopt a superior method of indexing layers
3. Sanity tests for frozen layers and unfrozen layers
4. Baselines (random network, random stitch)
5. `TODO`
