I think that stitching is the way to go.

DeeBert was an interesting idea, but I think we should put that on the shelf for now.

I avoided perciever, since I don't think it's totally relevant. It's primarily trying to do
something else: it's trying to make transformers that are more generally applicable to massive sources of data.

PonderNet seems to be almost exactly the idea I had. Darn it they beat me to it! I'll come back to it later, but I also
do not think it's the direction to go now, at least yet. PonderNet may be useful for physics problems where
we need to execute algorithmic procedures. The types of tasks they use PonderNet for are primarily algorithmic,
so it also might have some merit to try it on vision or language or other such tasks.
