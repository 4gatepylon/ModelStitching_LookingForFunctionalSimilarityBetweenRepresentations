Right now (Sept 23rd, 2021) we are in the process of figuring out where to take the research. There are many interesting directions.

I'm very interested in this idea of stitching. I am also generally interested in what inductive biases we could use to induce human-like behavior. Also, I'm pretty set on doing something "continuous" insofar as I would like things like modularity to emerge from the design, not be pre-programmed in like AI Feynman 2.0. However, it's important to narrow down now, so I will be updating this with a more narrow direction, shortly.
